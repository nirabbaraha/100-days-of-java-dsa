ðŸ”· What is a 2D Array?
A 2D array (two-dimensional array) is like a table or a matrix. It is a collection of data organized in rows and columns.
Think of it as:

| 1  2  3 |
| 4  5  6 |
| 7  8  9 |
This 3Ã—3 table is a 2D array with:
3 rows
3 columns

ðŸ”· How is it Stored in Memory?
Even though it looks like a grid, in memory it's stored as a single continuous block (row by row). For example, the matrix above is stored like this in memory:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
This is called row-major order (used in Java, C, C++).

ðŸ”· Indexing in 2D Array
-> To access an element, we need:
-> Row index (starts from 0)
-> Column index (starts from 0)

For example, matrix[1][2] means:
-> 2nd row (index 1)
-> 3rd column (index 2)
-> So it gives the value 6 from the matrix above.

ðŸ”· Use Cases of 2D Arrays
-> Grids in games (like chess, tic-tac-toe)
-> Image pixels (rows Ã— columns of colors)
-> Maps and pathfinding algorithms
-> Dynamic Programming problems (e.g. DP tables)
-> Matrix operations in math and physics
